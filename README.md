I'm 19 years of age.
I've spent a year working after graduating my high school. 
The whole year was spent contemplating about which education I would pick next.
I've looked a lot into business and economics as that was some of my main interests.
But recently my interests changed, and now I'm applying for CS in Aarhus University. 
I am here to learn.
